# Marias-rockpaperscissors_game
Was trying to do some simple coding while practicing for an upcoming midterm and decided to create a little game!


In this project, with the codes I have created, python implements a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a user interface. 
The game begins by prompting players of the game to press "Enter" to start and begin. 

The player is asked to specify the number of games they want to play against the imaginary player (being python with the randomized function). 
The game loop runs until the specified number of games is reached, e.g. 3 games will have 3 rounds.
During each iteration, the player is prompted to input their choice using the word or first letter (Rock: R, Paper:P, or Scissors:S), and the computer randomly generates its choice. 
The winner of each round is determined based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules, and the scores for the user and computer are updated accordingly. 
The game continues until the specified number of games is played.

And then lastly, the program prints the final scores and lets the player know whether they won, lost, or tied the overall game. 
And if the player wants to play again, they are given the option to play again by pressing "Enter".

Ta da!
